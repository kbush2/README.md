1. Open Splunk Search & Reporting app
2. Run a base search (e.g. `index=_internal sourcetype=splunkd`)
3. Save search as a **Report** and configure scheduling options
4. Create an **Alert** with trigger conditions (real-time or scheduled)
5. Configure **throttling and permissions**
6. Test and validate triggered actions (e.g. email, webhook, log entry)
